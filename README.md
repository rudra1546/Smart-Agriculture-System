## d. Problem Definition

Traditional agriculture faces challenges such as unpredictable crop yield, inefficient soil nutrient usage, and late detection of crop diseases. Farmers often lack access to data-driven tools, leading to crop loss, financial instability, and unsustainable farming practices.

There is a need for a smart system that can assist farmers in making informed decisions using modern technology.

## f. Implementation Details

The Smart Agriculture System is a web-based application that integrates frontend, backend, database, and machine learning components.

### Key Features:
- **Crop Yield Prediction**  
  Predicts crop yield using soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH value, crop type, season, field area, and weather data.

- **Interactive Field Mapping**  
  Uses GPS-based maps to allow farmers to select their farmland and calculate accurate field area.

- **Crop Health Analysis**  
  Image-based analysis helps detect crop diseases at an early stage.

- **User Authentication & History**  
  Each user can log in and view their prediction history through a personalized dashboard.

The system follows a **React → Flask API → ML Model → MySQL** architecture.
